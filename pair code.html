    <h1>2023 Israel–Hamas war</h1>
  </header>
  <section>

    <p>
      An armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups[t] has been taking place chiefly in and around the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023, with clashes also taking place in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and on the Israel–Lebanon border. On that day, militant groups launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, marking the start of the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War exactly fifty years prior.[72] After clearing Hamas militants from its territory, the Israeli military embarked on an extensive aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion. These hostilities constitute the fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict, which is part of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Iran–Israel proxy conflict.

      The war began when Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise offensive against Israel named "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood." The attack began with a barrage of rockets targeting Israel, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacked neighboring Israeli communities and military bases. During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, of whom 766 were civilians.[u][73][74][75] Hamas stated its attack was in response to the "desecration" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, settler violence and clashes there, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners,[76] the latter of whom it sought to free by taking an estimated 253 Israeli and foreign captives into Gaza as leverage.[77][78][79] In response, Israel declared a state of war and launched a counteroffensive named "Operation Swords of Iron." During the course of this operation, Israel tightened its blockade, ordered the evacuation of the northern Gaza Strip, and fired over 29,000 munitions in an extensive aerial bombardment campaign in Gaza before and during its ground offensive, which began on October 27.[80] Israel's stated goals included destroying Hamas, freeing the hostages and controlling the Gaza Strip.[81][82]

      Since the Israeli operation started, over 24,100 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza,[31] including over 10,000 children[83] and 7,000 women[32] with another 7,000 people missing and presumed dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings.[32][31] The scale and pace of destruction in Gaza is among the most severe in modern history.[84][85][86][vague] A severe humanitarian crisis has resulted, with healthcare in a state of collapse,[87] shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel,[88][89][90] electricity and communications blackouts,[91] and the UN warning of potential famine.[92] It was widely reported that there is "no safe place in Gaza" as Israel struck areas it had previously told Palestinians to evacuate to.[93][94][95] The widespread civilian deaths have led to accusations of war crimes against both Israel and Hamas.[96][97] Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million population[98] and around 500,000 Israelis have been internally displaced,[99] while thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel,[100][101][102] and Israel has lost over 150 further soldiers in its counteroffensive.[citation needed]

      Throughout the war, there have been widespread global protests that have primarily called for a ceasefire or the release of the hostages.[103][104][105] Israel and the United States have been described as internationally isolated[106][107][108] as the latter vetoed multiple UN Security Council resolutions proposing a ceasefire,[109][110][111] instead allowing one calling for a humanitarian pause to pass on 15 November.[112] During a subsequent seven-day truce, 105 Israeli hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners.[113] US military and diplomatic support for Israel during the war has been condemned by various human rights groups.[114][115][116] Iranian-backed militias attacked American bases in Iraq and Syria, while the United States and United Kingdom engaged in conflict with the Houthi movement in Yemen over its attacks on ships in the Red Sea it claimed were linked to Israel.[117]

      Background

  </header>
  <section>
    <p>
      Israel occupied the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, in 1967. While Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the United Nations and several human rights organizations continue to regard Gaza as occupied by Israel due the Israeli maritime blockade, control over all but one border crossing, and control over most of the electricity supply.[121][122] Israel disputes this based on its lack of direct military control on the ground.[123]
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1987, the First Intifada began, a popular uprising by the Palestinians against the Israeli occupation.[124] The conflict lasted five years and ended with the Oslo Accords, creating the Palestinian National Authority and dividing the West bank into three administrative areas.[125] Following the failure of the subsequent peace talks at the Camp David Summits in 2000,[126] violence once again escalated during the Second Intifada, which ended with the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit and Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.[127][128]
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, which led to it taking over governance in the strip, and further escalating tensions with Israel.[129][130] Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification.[131] International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment,[132][133] while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory.[134][135]
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the blockade, Israel and Palestinian militants have had several clashes and made attacks on each other.[131][136][137] The Palestinian Authority has not held national elections since 2006.[131][138] Hamas tunneled under the border wall to launch cross-border attacks and fired rockets into Israeli territory. This led to multiple conflicts, escalating into outright wars. Israel relied on the Iron Dome rocket defense system for defense, and responded with targeted strikes into Gaza, aiming to minimize the militant threat.[137] Surveys in 2023 of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank before the war indicated that a majority supported the use of "armed struggle", the creation of "militant groups", and an intifada ("uprising") against the Israeli occupation.[139][140]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gaza Strip's economy declined greatly due to the blockade, with a 30% drop in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) within a year. By 2015, the unemployment rate had risen to 45% (compared to the pre-blockade level of 10%).[141] In 2023, UNRWA statistics for Gaza reported 81% of people living below the poverty level, and 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance.[120] According to UNICEF, "Israel only approves 64%" of patients requests to leave Gaza for specialized medical treatment.[142] According to an analysis in The Independent, the Gaza blockade created hopelessness among Palestinians, which was exploited by Hamas, convincing young Palestinian men that violence was their only solution.[143] Daoud Kuttab wrote that Palestinian attempts to solve the conflict via negotiations or non-violent boycotts have been fruitless.[144]
    </p>

      Hamas is designated as a terrorist entity by the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and the European Union.[145][146][72][147] Other UNSC permanent members China[148] and Russia have not done so.[149][109][150] A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for "acts of terror" at the United Nations failed to achieve the required two-thirds majority, with 87 votes in favor, 58 votes against, 32 abstentions and 16 non-votes.[151] The UN Israeli Ambassador at the time criticized the procedure, stating the vote had been "hijacked" due to a change in procedure requiring a two-thirds majority instead of a simple majority which would have passed the motion.[152]
    </p>
    <p>
      In February–March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to jointly conduct elections for a new Palestinian legislative assembly, in accordance with the Oslo Accords. Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmoud Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States.[153] Soon after, the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis exploded, the Al-Aqsa Brigades started planning the operation which would break out on 7 October 2023.[153][154]
